In this Project, I created the Guesser Game in which there is 1 Guesser who guesses some Number and we have N no of Players who also guesses some Number.

There are 4 rounds in this Game and we can play each round any no. of times depending upon how many Players left in the Guessor Game.
N = No. of Players left
1. If N<=16 & N>8, then players will play the Round of N e.g. Round of 16, Round of 13 etc.
2. If N<=8 & N>4, then players will play the Quarter Finale.
3. If N<=4 & N>2, then players will play the Semi Finale.
4. If N=2, then players will play the Finale.
5. If N=1, then player play as an individual.

<-- Condition of the Game -->
1. The range of No. of Players who can participate in the Guessor Game is 1 to 16.
2. The range of No. guessed by Players and the Guessor is 1 to 50.
3. If Player guessed No. matches with the Guesser guessed No. , then Player will move to the next Round or will win if no Player is left.
4. If Player guessed No. doesn't matches with the Guessor guessed No. , then 1 Lifeline will be provided to the Player automatically and they will move to the next round.
5. If Player guessed No. doesn't matches with the Guessor guessed No. and Player has no Lifeline left, then Player will be out of the game.
6. If all players guessed No. matches with the Guesser No. , then the Game is Tied.
7. If all players guessed No. doesn't matches with the Guessor guessed No. and they all had no Lifeline left, then the Game is over. No player won the Guessor Game.
8. If only one player is left, then they automatically will be the winner.
